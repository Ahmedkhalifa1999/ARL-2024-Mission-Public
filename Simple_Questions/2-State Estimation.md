# Kalman Filter
- What do you know about Kalman Filters? Describe how it can be used in vehicle localization with a block diagram showing the estimation loop.
- Imagine you're working on a self-driving car project and need to localize a vehicle in an unknown environment using a Kalman filter. Which states would you choose to estimate, and what types of sensors would you use to obtain the necessary data?
# SLAM
- Explain the concept of SLAM, mentioning different types of it.
- How can we build a map in SLAM? What type of sensors might be useful for doing this task?
- How does SLAM perform vehicle localization in an unknown environment? Discuss in two different types of SLAM.

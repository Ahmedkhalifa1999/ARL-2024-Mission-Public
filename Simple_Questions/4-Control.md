# Control Theory and Philosophy
- What do you know about control? What do you understand by the term "control theory"? Describe its significance in engineering and real-world applications.
- Explain the difference between open-loop and closed-loop control systems with examples. Discuss the concept of feedback in control systems. Imagine a situation that you need a feedback for the control?

# PID Control
- What is a PID controller? Explain the components (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) and their respective roles in a PID control system.
- Describe the effect of each component (P, I, D), How do you tune a PID controller? Discuss at least two different methods for PID tuning.
- Imagine you are designing a temperature control system for an industrial furnace. How would you implement a PID controller for this application? Include a block diagram illustrating the control loop.
- What are the limitations of PID controllers, and in what scenarios might other types of controllers be more appropriate?

# Graph Search Algorithms
Graph searching algorithms are the cornerstone of path planning algorithms, the most popular of which are: BFS, DFS, Dijkstraâ€™s and A\* algorithms 
  
- Briefly describe how each of those algorithms work.  
- Mention the pros and cons of each algorithm.  

# Practical Motion Planning
A Vaccum cleaning robot uses A\* algorithm to navigate its way through the house, however the paths it navigates are often too rough (Zig-Zag).
- As a motion planning engineer what could be a solution to this problem in the algorithm?  
- What is the risk of applying such a solution?

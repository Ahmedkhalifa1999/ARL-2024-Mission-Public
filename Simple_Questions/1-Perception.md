# Perception Sensors
- Explain the working principles (i.e. how they capture data from the environments, the type of data captured, data processing requirements, etc.) of radars, lidars and cameras.

# Stereo Vision
- Explain how two cameras can be used to get 3D poisition information about objects.

# Machine Learning
- What are neural networks? How do they learn?
- How can neural networks be used to aid with processing sensor data for envorionment perception?
